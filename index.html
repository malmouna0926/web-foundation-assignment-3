        <p1>The year was 1967. Mercedes-Benz was known for producing sedate luxury sedans rather than for winning the Mille Miglia and La Carrera Panamericana road races.
             At that time, a pair of former Mercedes employees got together to form an independent shop devoted to increasing the performance of their erstwhile employer’s cars.
            Hans-Werner Aufrecht and his partner Erhard Melcher founded AMG, naming the company after the initials of their last names, plus Aufrecht’s home town of Grossaspach. 
            Both men had been employed at Mercedes-Benz as “engineering, design and testing specialists in the development of racing engines.” 
            They set up their speed shop inside an old mill in Burgstall, a little town northeast of Stuttgart, where Mercedes-Benz is headquartered.
            Envisioned as a racing shop, the duo made their reputation preparing the Mercedes-Benz 300SE sedan for competition in the European Touring Car series.
            Still, on occasion, they would also modify street cars for enhanced performance. The stately Mercedes-Benz sedans of the era seemed ridiculous on a racing track, 
            but the formula worked. AMG took their first racing victory at a grueling endurance race in 1971</p1>

        <p2>The first BMW M3 was based on the E30 3 Series and was intended to be a homologation special to satisfy the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft and Group A Touring rules, 
            which required a total of 5,000 cars to be built.[4] It was presented to the public at the 1985 Frankfurt Motor Show, and began production from March 1986 to June 1991.
            The E30 M3 was mainly produced in the coupé body style, but limited volumes of convertibles were also produced. 
            In 2004, Sports Car International named the E30 M3 number six on the list of Top Sports Cars of the 1980s. In 2007,
            Automobile Magazine included the E30 M3 in their "5 greatest drivers cars of all time" under their 25 Greatest Cars of All Time</p2></section>
